# GainzFinder
This project is a reboot of a project I worked on for client side last fall. The concept is an app that will use the users current location to locate gyms within a specified radius. Then using those gyms the app will find what gyms offer a single-use/day rate and present the cheapest options first.  The inspiration comes from when I was traveling and had a hard time finding a place to workout that didn't require me to sign up for at least a month. So the target users are travelers that are also gym rats.  Useful APIs are Google's location services and Places APIs. The Google Maps Time Zone API might be useful for finding gyms that are open right now in the case that some might not be open 24/7.  The coupon searching service Honey is a source of inspiration and a possible API source. It looks for coupons on the internet which is similar to what we are looking for. RetailMeNot and Groupon are two other similar services that connect potential customers to businesses with coupon codes as the bridge.
